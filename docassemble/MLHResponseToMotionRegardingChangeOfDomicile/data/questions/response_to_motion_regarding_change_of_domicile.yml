question: |
  If Your Child's Other Parent Wants to Move
subquestion: |
  If there is a custody or parenting time order for your child, the other parent **must** get the court’s approval before moving his or her residence **outside Michigan**.
  
  A parent may also need permission from the court to move **within Michigan**. This depends on things like:

  * The custody and parenting time arrangements 
  * How far the proposed move is
  * How far the parents lived from one another when the case started
  * Whether the other parent agrees to the move

  If your child’s other parent has filed a *Motion Regarding Change of Domicile/Legal Residence* asking the court to move, you can file a response. The court will have a hearing where the other parent can say why they want to move, and you can say if you disagree.
  
  On the court forms, the other parent is called the **moving party** because they are the person filing the motion. You may be the plaintiff or the defendant in the family law case where you’re filing this response.
  To learn more about what to do if your child’s other parent wants to move with your child, read [Responding to a Motion to Change Domicile](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/family/responding-motion-change-domicile).

# question: |
#   You will be asked questions about yourself and the other parent.
# subquestion: |
#   On the court forms, the other party is called the moving party because they are the person filing the motion.

#   You may be the plaintiff or the defendant in the family law case where you’re filing this response.

#   This tool should take you between forty minutes and one hour to finish.

#   After you answer all the questions, you will be ready to download or print a *Response to Motion Regarding Change of Domicile/Legal Residence*.

#   This tool will ask you questions to make sure this form is right for you, and it will use your answers to fill out the form. You’ll need to look at a copy of the most recent custody order and a copy of the other parent's *Motion Regarding Change of Domicile/Legal Residence* while you’re using this tool.

question: |
  Completing this process does not file your forms with the court
subquestion: |
  You need to file them at court in person, by mail, e-mail, or by e-filing.
  If you are e-filing, you must use https://mifile.courts.michigan.gov/.
  Read the instructions that you will get with your forms for more information.

  ${ collapse_template(am_i_going_to_efile) }

  This tool will create separate forms so you can more easily e-file using MiFILE, if you plan to e-file.

  This means that *you may need to download multiple files to get all of the forms you will need*. At the end of this interview you will see a list of documents to download. Make sure you download each of them. 

  You will also be able to get all forms you need by clicking the *Download Your Form(s)* button on the page at the end of this tool.

  How do I know if I am going to e-file?
content: |
  Not all courts offer e-filing at this time. To find out if your court has e-filing, read the
  https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/mifile/what-e-filing article.
  The article tells you how to find out which courts have e-filing and what kinds of cases those courts are accepting by e-filing.

  Look for the two-letter case type code at the end of your case number.
  (This could be DM, DC, DS, DP, or a different code.)

question: |
  Welcome to Michigan Legal Help’s Do-It-Yourself Response to Motion to Change Domicile/Residence tool.  
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you prepare the forms to file a *Response to Motion Regarding Change of Domicile/Legal Residence* in Michigan.  

  If there is a custody or parenting time order for your child, the other parent must get the court’s approval before moving his or her residence from Michigan.
continue button field: intro_screen
---
id: intro_screen_2
question: |
  A parent may also need permission from the court to move within Michigan. 
subquestion: |  
  This depends on things like:
  
  * The custody and parenting time arrangements ${"\n"}
  * How far the proposed move is${"\n"}
  * How far the parents lived from one another when the case started${"\n"}
  * Whether the other parent agrees to the move
  
  If your child’s other parent has filed a Motion Regarding Change of Domicile/Legal Residence asking the court to move, you can file a response. The court will have a hearing where the other parent can talk about why they want to move, and you can talk about why you object.

  To learn more about what to do if your child’s other parent wants to move with your child, read [Responding to a Motion to Change Domicile](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/family/responding-motion-change-domicile).

  This tool will ask you questions to make sure this form is right for you, and it will use your answers to fill out the form. You’ll need to look at a copy of the most recent custody order and a copy of the other parent's Motion to Change Domicile/Residence while you’re using this tool.
continue button field: intro_screen_2
---
id: intro_screen_3
question: |
  You will be asked questions about yourself and the other parent. 
subquestion: |  
  On the court forms, the other party is called the moving party because they are the person filing the motion.
  
  You may be the plaintiff or the defendant in the family law case where you’re filing this response.
  
  This tool should take you between forty minutes and one hour to finish.

  After you answer all the questions, you will be ready to download or print a:
    
   • *Response to Motion Regarding Change of Domicile/Legal Residence with Attachment*

  If you make a mistake, you can press the **Undo** button on the bottom of the screen. If you need to go back or forward several questions, use the outline on the left side of the screen.

  This tool will ask you questions to make sure this form is right for you, and it will use your answers to fill out the form. You’ll need to look at a copy of the most recent custody order and a copy of the other parent's Motion to Change Domicile/Residence while you’re using this tool.
